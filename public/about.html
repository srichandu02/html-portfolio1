<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a passionate and curious Computer Science and Engineering student, 
  currently pursuing my B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Anil Neerukonda Institute of Technology and Sciences (ANITS), Vizag. As a tech enthusiast with a strong interest in the rapidly evolving world of AI,
   I am always eager to learn, experiment, and apply what I learn to real-world challenges.</p>

<p>From an early age, I’ve been intrigued by how technology shapes the world around us.
   This curiosity has grown into a deep interest in problem-solving, coding, and machine learning. 
   I have developed strong programming skills in Python and C, and
    I’m also comfortable working with data structures, algorithms, and core subjects like Operating Systems,
     Computer Networks, and DBMS. I have achieved certifications in Python (Udemy - Abdul Bari) and through HackerRank,
   which helped solidify my fundamentals and improve my problem-solving skills.</p>

<p>In my academic journey, I have taken a proactive approach to learning. 
  I’ve enrolled in NPTEL courses like “Data Structures and Algorithms using Python,” 
  which strengthened my understanding of algorithmic thinking. 
  I enjoy working on hands-on projects and assignments that challenge my logical thinking, and I constantly strive to improve by analyzing my mistakes and seeking feedback.
   I’m currently learning JavaScript and exploring full-stack development to expand my skill set beyond backend and AI-focused topics.

Beyond academics, I believe in the power of collaboration and social impact. I am a member of Street Cause, where I contribute to community service initiatives.
 This involvement has not only helped me grow as a responsible individual but also taught me the importance of teamwork, empathy, and 
 leadership.

I’m also health-conscious and actively maintain a fitness routine, including regular workouts at the gym.
 Balancing academics with physical well-being has helped me stay focused, disciplined, and energetic.

My goal is to build a meaningful career in AI and Machine Learning where I can use my knowledge to develop intelligent solutions that address real-world problems.
 I’m particularly interested in areas like computer vision, NLP, and reinforcement learning, and I aspire to work on innovative projects that push the boundaries of what’s possible with AI.</p>

<p>I believe in continuous learning, and I’m not afraid to start from scratch when exploring new domains.
   Whether it’s experimenting with a new programming language, debugging code late into the night, or learning from failed attempts, 
  I treat every experience as a stepping stone toward growth.</p>

<p>As I progress in my academic and professional journey, I am looking forward to internships, research opportunities, and collaborations that allow me to contribute, learn, and make a difference. I’m excited about the future and am committed to working hard, staying curious, and becoming the best version of myself—both as a technologist and as a human being.</p>
